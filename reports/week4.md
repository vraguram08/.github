# Week 4 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Our plan is to have the frontend group finish implementing the calendar view and the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries as soon as possible. Then, we can continue building the auto scheduling algorithm with the plan to finish it at about 70%.
2. We mostly worked on the Architecture and Design assignment. We also created an empty Ruby on Rail project as well as an empty React Native project. The interface and calendar view mockups are also accomplished. The database schema is also finalized. We learned that we are a little behind without schedule, but we have a clear expectation and layout of what to accomplish next.
3. Our plan is to have the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries. The frontend group will start building calendar layout and implementing http requests to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.

#### Agenda for project meeting with TA:

## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. I will start to figure out how the React Native framework works and collaborate with Jacob to work on the calendar view with the goal to finish it early in order to get started on the auto scheduling algorithm.
2. I worked with other team members to finish the Architecture and Design assignment as well as finalized our data schema. I have a clear expectation of the project's architecture and design constraints, and I have not encountered any troubles.
3. My plan is to work with Jacob to build the calendar layout and implementing the http requests in order to retrieve the calendar data through the REST API.

#### Thompson:
1. Next week I will hopefully have everything set up, have the database completed, and start setting up the rest of the backend (e.g. login authentication).
2. I helped the team finish defining the architecture and design of our project. We also have a better understanding of how we want to represent data in our databases.
3. I will continue working on helping the backend team create the database queries and help set up automated testing.

#### Vasudev:
1. Next week I will work on the login authentication part of the backend.
2. The overall skeleton of the project is looking good now, all it needs now is to be filled out with code.
3. I'll keep trying to get over my anxieties and contribute to the backend delevopment of this application.
