# Week 3 Status Report

## Team Report

1. Our plan is to have the REST API specified and a repository is set up on Github first. Then, the frontend group will start working on building the calendar view, and the backend group will start creating a database and querying.
2. Our group finished setting up a repository on Github, and the specification for the REST API is also almost finished. We just started the implementation of the calendar application this week. We learned that we are a little bit behind the schedule due to the delay in setting up the repository. This means that we might not be able to finish the calendar view and database creation by 1/26 according to our planned schedule.
3. Our plan is to have the frontend group finish implementing the calendar view and the backend group finish the creation of the database and queries as soon as possible. Then, we can continue building the auto scheduling algorithm with the plan to finish it at about 70%.

#### Agenda for project meeting with TA:
Feedback on the architecture model and Github repository



## Contributions of individual team members

#### Cat:
1. In the following week, I will participate in team meetings to have the REST API specified and work on building the calendar view.
2. I collaborated with team members to have the REST API specified and the repository is set up. There is little delay in starting the implementation of the calendar, but everything should be on track.
3. I will start to figure out how the React Native framework works and collaborate with Jacob to work on the calendar view with the goal to finish it early in order to get started on the auto scheduling algorithm.

#### Marlena:
1.  In the coming week I will contribute to the team building of the API and I will work on the Git setup assignment. I will also start work on the database creation/queries with the backend group.
2. I attended team meetings in person and on zoom- in these meetings I participated in specifying the REST API, revising out Requirements assignment from last week for resubmission, and completing the Git assignment. We are delayed in creating the database, but will be able to plan how to get this done when we meet tomorrow. I learned about the structure of a Ruby project this week while we worked on the Git assignment.
3. In the coming week I will work on the completion of the database, and we are scheduled to design the auto-scheduling algorithm as well.

#### Thompson:
1. For next week I will work with the team to work on the REST API and start working on creating databases/queries with the backend team.
2. I helped the team define and specify the REST API. I have yet to start working on the database/backend, but should have better progress this week.
3. Next week I will hopefully have everything set up, have the database completed, and start setting up the rest of the backend (e.g. login authentication).
